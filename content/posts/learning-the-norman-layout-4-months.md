About 4 months after changing the typing layout to Norman.
I think I will type with Norman last a long time (unless I'm interesting w/ another one).

# I forgot QWERTY

Typing bopomofo (Chinese typing, and it's [interesting story](https://twitter.com/rqou_/status/1101331385632022528) is another challenge on ErgoDox, so first, I flash my ErgoDox's firmware to use Norman, then I can still type bopomofo on my laptop's keyboard. I will have some time will type with QWERTY. I can change both layout in minutes on that time.

But changing keyboard is clumsy. I start to use IME to change Norman and bopomofo after a month. That means my small time with QWERTY is gone. And I found that I cannot type with QWERTY fluently. OMG I forgot QWERTY! Feeling annoying when use other people's laptop.

# Deliberate practicing is important

Achieve 40 ~ 50 WPM in 2 month. Guess how many WPM I can type after 4 months?
Only 50 WPM, haha.

I practice almost randomly. Maybe twice a week and last about 5 or 10mins.
To my way of thinking I will more, more faster since I type it all day. But the reality is not.

I still cannot type 60~70 easily. I think deliberate practicing and keep 1 or 2 month then I can achieve it.
But 50 WPM is enough for me, maybe I will continue the lesson someday.

# End?

I still cannot type in  6,70 speed. But I use Norman happily. Also found some bigram I struggle on it.
Like `ck` `jp` `jpy` but it's not a popular bigrams.

I guess every layout have it's own hard bigrams. Norman still a good candidate from QWERTY. Maybe it's time to check Dvorak (the disaster you know).
